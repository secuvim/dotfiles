# Dotfiles
Configuration files for a productive environment using
* zsh
* tmux
* neovim

## Setup
The setup script will link all files to your $HOME folder allowing updates by
pulling new versions of the repository. Be awary that executing the script WILL
DELETE all customizations used in your current configuration files. If you
decide to use the script, make sure to execute it from within the directory.
